# Maze Solver

This project is a visual maze-solving algorithm implemented in Python using the Tkinter and Pillow library
The project features the creation of a maze where a character (Link) solves the maze and reaches the end (Zelda).

### Showcase

### Features
- **Maze Generation**: A randomized maze generation using depth-first search algorithm, which visually shows the walls and pathways as they are created.
- **Maze Solving**: A depth-first search pathfinding algorithm that animates Link moving through the maze towards Zelda at the exit.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your computer
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marcus-Gustafsson/Maze_Solver_Boot_dev.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the `main.py` script to start the maze generation and solution.
```bash
python main.py
```
4. Enjoy watching the maze being solved with animated sprites!
